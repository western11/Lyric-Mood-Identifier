# Lyric-Mood-Identifier
Predict the song's mood based on its lyric

This project is based on this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/edenbd/150k-lyrics-labeled-with-spotify-valence). The dataset contains 250k lyric with Valence value gathered using Spotify API. Valence is A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). Our task in this article is to perform supervised NLP sentiment analysis to measure the positiveness of a song. This kind of analysis can be used for the Spotify company itself to improve its music recommender system based on lyric (words).

Limitation: Languange are wide and complex. NLP are also known to its high computational value. So in this analysis i will only use english song lyrics and sampled the data to only 45k songs.

The final code are stored at mk3.Rmd and you can see the result at mk3.html
